These are model outputs, coefficients and variance-covariance estimates for those coefficients (ie for the model coefficients THESE ARE NOT correlations/covariances for the prevalence of the conditions in the population).
 from Gompertz survival models. The models were fit on very large datasets; these included all men and women aged 50 or older registered with a pracitce during 2011. Models were fit separately for men and women. For women there were 440563 patients and 70720 events. 
For men there were 399649 patients and 65178 events. The model treated age as the timescale and included 11 parameters for each of the co-morbidities. It also included age-co-morbidity interaction terms.

In addition to the model outputs I have included tables comparing life expectancy in these data to those provided by the WHO (as a check on the results) diagnostic plots for the Gompertz distribution, and plots of the survival according to age and comorbidity.
